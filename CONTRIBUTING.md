ðŸ‘‹ Hi and welcome! Thanks for taking the time to contribute and make this component library better for everyone.
ðŸ’ª

Currently there's no forking / PR functionality for Figma community files, though once [branching and merging](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063144053-Create-branches-and-merge-changes) is complete maybe that might be in the future? ðŸ¤ž

In the meantime, please submit updated files against this repository and we will manually update the Figma file.

## Tutorial:
1. Fork the file by duplicating it from the community version.
2. Make your changes.
3. [Export the Figma file](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511573-Move-files-and-projects#export) as a `.fig` file.
4. [Create an issue](https://github.com/figma/architecture-diagram-components/issues) for this repository and attach the `.fig` file.

NOTE: It seems easier and more accessible to create an issue rather than open a PR (and we're not getting much use out of the file diff-ing functionality), but opening a PR is also welcome!
